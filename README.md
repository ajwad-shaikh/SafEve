# SafEve Monitor
Android Application to monitor alerts from SafEve Devices

SafEve is a safety device conceptualised during the National Innovation Drive Hackathon 2017, at PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design & Manufacturing, Jabalpur.

The device is aims to enhance safety of users with limited access or knowledge of technology viz. rural population, children. The device features a trigger button that sends a geo-tagged distress signal wirelessly over 2G band to nearby help viz. a police station. It works as an independent device and NOT as a peripheral to a Smartphone or Computer. The SafEve Monitor App is designed for the designated help to manage the distress signals and respond effectively and immediately.

The Application maintains an SQLite user database consisting of name and phone-number. The database is editable and any number of new SafEve users can be added spontaneously. The application then notifies the designated help immediately upon receiving a distress signal from any of the users with a link to the user's GSM location. The location opens instantly in a Google Maps intent. 

The Application reads distress signals received as Short Messages (SMS) on the device from numbers aforementioned in the database and displays them in a timestamped listview on the monitor screen.
